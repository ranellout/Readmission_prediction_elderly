Multimodal Machine Learning for Prediction of 30-day Readmission Risk in Elderly Population

This repository contains the analytic code for the development and validation of three machine leaning models for the prediction of 30-day readmission among elderly patients who were admitted to internal medicine departments.
In this repository you can find files for the training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis of the models, as well as hyperparameters txt file under the ML models folder. Under the NLP_social_assessments folder you can find py files for the creation of the feature 'NLP score' that was based on the social worker's assessment letters.
